      <h1> Exercise </h1>
      <h3> HIIT Training </h3>
    <p> HIIT training stands for High Intensity Interval Training - a form of cardiovascular exercise.
    <br>
    This involves work periods ranging from 30 seconds to three minutes,
    working between 80â€“100% of your maximum heart rate with short recovery periods.
    There is no specific formula to HIIT,
    but as a rule of thumb your recovery period should be at least the same as your work interval and can become shorter as you get fitter. </p>
